  prompt: `You are an expert accountant. Your task is to analyze a bank transaction description and identify which customer made the payment.

Analyze the transaction description and choose the most appropriate customer from the provided list. You should look for either the customer's name or a specific invoice number in the transaction description.

**Transaction Description**: {{{description}}}

**List of Customers and their Invoices**:
\`\`\`json
{{{customers}}}
\`\`\`

Based on the description, provide the customer ID. Your confidence score should reflect how specific the description is. 
- If you find an exact invoice number or a full name match, confidence should be high (90-100).
- If you find a partial name match, confidence should be medium (60-80).
- If the description is too generic (e.g., "INTERNET TRANSFER") or doesn't match anyone, confidence should be very low (0-20), and you should not return a customerId.
- For the vatType, you must always return 'no_vat' as VAT is accounted for on the original sales invoice, not the payment receipt.
